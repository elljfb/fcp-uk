<p><strong>Stormzy has once again teamed up with adidas to launch #Merky FC Football Careers Season 2, an initiative aimed at creating leadership opportunities in football for the Black community.</strong></p>



<p>The program was originally created in response to the fact that currently only 6.7% of leadership positions in football are held by those with Black heritage. Through <a href="https://merkyfc.com/">#Merky FC Football Careers</a>, Stormzy and adidas hope to address the lack of fair access and representation for Black individuals looking to build careers in the sport.</p>



<p>The multi-year partnership will provide a career development program and job placements across various roles in football, at various businesses including professional football clubs and media outlets.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="670" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_6603-1024x670.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-153" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_6603-1024x670.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_6603-300x196.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_6603-768x503.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_6603.jpg 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The brands and businesses working with Adidas and Merky FC this year</figcaption></figure>



<p>The first season of placements under #Merky FC Football Careers launched in November 2022 with 11 major brands participating. 15 Young black people from the UK earned jobs in the football industry as a result of Merky FC, and this year the second season will kick off in October 2023 with over 50 new placement opportunities.</p>



<p>Stormzy said &#8220;There&#8217;s still a massive gap in representation off the pitch&#8221;. He hopes the program will &#8220;create long-lasting change&#8221; and build a pipeline of future Black leaders in football. <a href="https://www.adidas.co.uk/football">Adidas</a> emphasized the importance of diversity and equal representation at all levels of the sport.</p>



<p>The initiative is the latest effort by Stormzy and adidas to increase inclusion and accessibility in football. Both have been outspoken advocates for racial equality in sport and society.</p>
