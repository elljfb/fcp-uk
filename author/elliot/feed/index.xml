<p><strong>Stormzy has once again teamed up with adidas to launch #Merky FC Football Careers Season 2, an initiative aimed at creating leadership opportunities in football for the Black community.</strong></p>



<p>The program was originally created in response to the fact that currently only 6.7% of leadership positions in football are held by those with Black heritage. Through <a href="https://merkyfc.com/">#Merky FC Football Careers</a>, Stormzy and adidas hope to address the lack of fair access and representation for Black individuals looking to build careers in the sport.</p>



<p>The multi-year partnership will provide a career development program and job placements across various roles in football, at various businesses including professional football clubs and media outlets.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="670" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_6603-1024x670.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-153" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_6603-1024x670.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_6603-300x196.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_6603-768x503.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_6603.jpg 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The brands and businesses working with Adidas and Merky FC this year</figcaption></figure>



<p>The first season of placements under #Merky FC Football Careers launched in November 2022 with 11 major brands participating. 15 Young black people from the UK earned jobs in the football industry as a result of Merky FC, and this year the second season will kick off in October 2023 with over 50 new placement opportunities.</p>



<p>Stormzy said &#8220;There&#8217;s still a massive gap in representation off the pitch&#8221;. He hopes the program will &#8220;create long-lasting change&#8221; and build a pipeline of future Black leaders in football. <a href="https://www.adidas.co.uk/football">Adidas</a> emphasized the importance of diversity and equal representation at all levels of the sport.</p>



<p>The initiative is the latest effort by Stormzy and adidas to increase inclusion and accessibility in football. Both have been outspoken advocates for racial equality in sport and society.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Once best known for his stellar football career, Gary Neville has recently grabbed headlines for his outspoken views on politics and social issues. The former Manchester United defender has never been shy about sharing his opinions, whether as a broadcaster or on social media. But his decision to join the Labour Party in January 2023 signaled a shift to becoming an active participant in politics.</strong></p>



<p>Neville&#8217;s footballing CV is impeccable &#8211; over 600 appearances for Manchester United, winning eight Premier League titles, three FA Cups, and two Champions Leagues. He was also England&#8217;s first-choice right-back for a decade, earning 85 caps. Since retiring in 2011, Neville has become a leading football pundit on Sky Sports and ITV. His frank, thoughtful analysis has earned him a reputation as the top commentator in the game.</p>



<p>Outside football, Neville has been vocal about poverty, sexism, racism, and the need to reform football governance. He has regularly criticized Boris Johnson&#8217;s government over their policies. But the move to officially join Labour has put Neville&#8217;s left-leaning politics into action. He has spoken of his ambition to influence policy debates and play a role in shaping Labour&#8217;s direction.</p>



<p>For many, Neville seems an unlikely political crusader. But his journey from the pitch to political activism reflects how some leading sports figures are choosing to use their profile to drive social change. As he sets out on this new path, all eyes will be on Neville to see if he can score key goals outside the sporting arena.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">From Player to Politico</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_6576-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-136" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_6576-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_6576-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_6576-768x432.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_6576-1536x864.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_6576.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gary Neville giving a speech (Image via Football365)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Neville publicly announced that he had joined the Labour Party in January 2023, saying he wanted to support the party after being impressed by leader Keir Starmer. This step formalized political allegiances that had been clear for some time from Neville&#8217;s commentary.</p>



<p>Throughout 2022, Neville was outspoken in his criticisms of Boris Johnson&#8217;s government over issues like parties during lockdown at Downing Street. He labeled ministers as &#8220;corrupt&#8221; and called for Johnson to resign. On social matters, Neville has backed football players taking the knee against racism. And he has argued for more taxation on the wealthy.</p>



<p>Neville has made the case that wealthy people like himself should contribute more. He supports Starmer&#8217;s policy of putting the top income tax rate back up to 50% for those earning over £125,000, a threshold encompassing Neville&#8217;s own earnings. The former footballer has also endorsed increased windfall taxes on the profits of energy companies.</p>



<p>On economic issues, Neville has praised Labour&#8217;s calls for increased public investment and for a strengthened social safety net. He has said he believes in the role of unions to represent workers. And he has criticized Sunak&#8217;s Government for being &#8220;anti-worker.&#8221;</p>



<p>Some see Neville&#8217;s motivations stemming from his close ties to Manchester and the inequalities he has seen in the city. He seems driven by a belief in using his wealth and public profile as a force for good. And he has hinted his new party membership is just the start of an active political role.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Broadcasting Platform</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_6577-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-137" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_6577-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_6577-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_6577-768x432.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_6577.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gary Neville appearing on Monday Night Football (Image via Sky Sports)</figcaption></figure>



<p>After hanging up his boots in 2011, Gary Neville soon transitioned into a prominent football punditry role with Sky Sports. His incisive, straight-talking analysis earned him plaudits and huge popularity with viewers.</p>



<p>Neville&#8217;s articles and podcasts also display his keen intellect &#8211; he gained a degree in Sports Science and Business Management in his playing days. Nevile has leveraged his broadcasting platform not just to discuss tactics and results, but increasingly to share his views on political and social issues.</p>



<p>On Sky&#8217;s Monday Night Football, Neville has used segments to argue against racism in football and society. And he has weighed in on controversies like the European Super League breakaway attempt. His high-profile likely gives his political messaging far more reach than the average pundit.</p>



<p>Neville has shown he won&#8217;t shy away from criticizing political leaders, no matter their affiliation. He condemned Boris Johnson for not resigning sooner amid partygate. And he has chastised Keir Starmer for not voicing stronger opposition on key issues.</p>



<p>This independent streak has earned Neville some backlash, but also respect for avoiding partisanship. And it suggests he won&#8217;t just toe the party line if elected. Neville has said he won&#8217;t abandon his &#8220;impartiality&#8221; as a broadcaster despite joining Labour.</p>



<p>With 5 million Twitter followers and a prime TV slot, Neville will likely continue using his broadcasting profile as a powerful platform. As he becomes more active in Labour politics, his outspoken takes on the issues of the day will be harder to ignore.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Following in Familiar Footsteps</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_6578-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-138" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_6578-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_6578-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_6578-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_6578-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_6578-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Cyrille Regis was a big campaigner against Racism in Football (Image via The Times)</figcaption></figure>



<p>While Gary Neville is one of the most prominent recent soccer stars to wade into politics, he follows a path blazed by several ex-players before him. The crossover from pitch to parliament shows how some aim to take their influence into public service after exiting sport.</p>



<p>One of the earliest high-profile cases was Cyrille Regis &#8211; the West Brom striker was a pioneering Black footballer in the 1970s and 80s before joining the Labour Party upon retirement. Regis served as a councillor in his hometown of Coventry and worked to tackle racism in the game.</p>



<p>Former Ireland and Arsenal player David O&#8217;Leary had a brief stint as a Conservative MP in 2002, utilizing his fame to get elected. And ex-England goalkeeper David James ran unsuccessfully as a Conservative council candidate in 2019 on a platform opposing a new stadium development.</p>



<p>The most successful politician offspring has been former Chelsea winger Wycombe Wanderers&#8217; mayor Peter Taylor. The long-serving councillor became the mayor of the town where his club is based in 2018.</p>



<p>Internationally, examples like George Weah of Liberia and Romario of Brazil show how ex-players have risen to head government ministries or even become president. Their sporting credentials and fame helped elevate their political profiles.</p>



<p>As Neville follows in these footsteps, his fellow footballers-turned-politicians provide models to emulate &#8211; and cautionary tales to avoid &#8211; in seeking to make an impact. Their mixed results show both the potential rewards and risks that come with moving from the locker room to the corridors of power.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Lessons from the Pitch to Parliament</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_6579.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-139" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_6579.jpg 1000w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_6579-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_6579-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">House of Commons (Image via gov.uk)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The paths of former players like Cyrille Regis and Romario demonstrate how transferring sporting profile into politics can bring extra attention and credibility. But the results have been mixed when it comes to achieving lasting policy change.</p>



<p>Regis took on an important role speaking out against racism in the game, using his reputation to influence attitudes. However, his impact as a Labour councillor was limited by staying at the local level. Romario gained hype as a congressman but ultimately did not run for re-election.</p>



<p>Ex-players often command respect immediately due to their sporting resumes. But critics argue they rarely put in the work required to gain expertise on complex policy issues. Gary Neville will need to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the workings of government to be taken seriously.</p>



<p>Staying on message is also key — O’Leary’s stint as an MP fizzled out quickly when he seemed more interested in photo ops than serving constituents. And David James&#8217; anti-stadium campaign smacked of opportunism to some.</p>



<p>One lesson is the need to pay dues with party activism before seeking office. Wycombe&#8217;s Peter Taylor built up decades of service before becoming mayor. Neville will need to avoid perceptions of simply leveraging his celebrity.</p>



<p>As Neville follows in their footsteps, he’ll have to prove his motivations go beyond vanity and tap into his sporting discipline. The path from locker room to parliament is filled with pitfalls. But the ex-Man United man has never shied away from a challenge on or off the pitch.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Prospects on the Campaign Trail</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="464" height="278" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_6580.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-140" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_6580.jpg 464w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_6580-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gary Neville speaking at a Labour Party Conference (Image via The Guardian)</figcaption></figure>



<p>If Gary Neville decides to run for elected office, either as an MP or a local councillor, what are his chances of success? His fame and resources would be significant advantages, but also potential liabilities.</p>



<p>On the positive side, Neville would receive wall-to-wall media coverage focusing on his candidacy. His name recognition is higher than virtually any other potential candidate. And with deep pockets, Neville could amply fund advertising and staff.</p>



<p>However, his lack of political experience could be viewed as a weakness by some voters. Rivals may attack him as an out-of-touch celebrity seeking power and fame. Maintaining discipline on the campaign trail will be critical.</p>



<p>Neville&#8217;s best bet would likely be running in his native Greater Manchester, where his local credentials and support for the region are well-established. He might aim for a safe Labour seat or local council ward.</p>



<p>But his close association with rival city Liverpool through footballing clashes could hamper wider support. And an urban seat with student and minority voters may prefer a non-celebrity candidate.</p>



<p>Much depends on how seriously Neville is willing to put in the work &#8211; pounding the pavement, fundraising, building alliances with activists. He can&#8217;t rely on name recognition alone.</p>



<p>While the path from punditry to parliament won&#8217;t be easy, Neville has overcome long odds before. With the right team and strategy, his political prospects can&#8217;t be counted out. But he will have to demonstrate true commitment to public service over his own ego.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="976" height="549" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_6581.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-141" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_6581.jpg 976w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_6581-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_6581-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 976px) 100vw, 976px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gary Neville with Labour Party Leader Kier Starmer (Image via the BBC)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Gary Neville&#8217;s decision to join Labour and become politically active has opened a new chapter for the former football star. His outspoken commentary and social media presence already leverage his profile, but seeking elected office would take things to a new level.</p>



<p>Neville follows a well-worn path of athletes aiming to influence issues they care about beyond the arena of competition. Some have achieved noteworthy success, while others have found politics isn&#8217;t as easy as anticipated. Maintaining authenticity and putting in the work will be critical tests for Neville.</p>



<p>Above all, Neville&#8217;s second act highlights the platform that high-profile figures like him have to drive change on important issues. At a time of economic hardship and widening inequality, Neville has made clear he wants to be part of the solution.</p>



<p>If he can translate even a fraction of his footballing dexterity, leadership and determination into the political sphere, Neville has the potential to impact policy debates and be a force for good. His path from Old Trafford to Whitehall faces major obstacles, but will be compelling to watch unfold.</p>



<p>For now, Gary Neville&#8217;s political activism reflects a willingness to contest a very different kind of high-stakes game to achieve positive change off the pitch. Where it ultimately leads depends greatly on Neville&#8217;s own willingness to put in the hard yards necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Football shirts in the 1980s made a bold statement by embracing the audacious styles and culture of the decade.</strong> As synthetic fabrics replaced traditional cotton, kit designs moved into daring new territory with abstract graphics, geometric patterns and vivid neon hues. Teams pushed the boundaries with shirts in bright greens, electric pinks, and citrus yellows that exemplified 1980s flair. Loud designs like Belgium’s red and black geometric patterned home shirt from 1984 burn themselves into fans’ memories. Other kits made a statement with multicoloured zig-zags, paint-splatter motifs, and clashing blocks of colour. By borrowing themes from 80s fashion, music and pop culture, football shirts shed their traditional looks and captured the brash, larger-than-life vibe that defined the decade. This article will explore some of the most memorable and emblematic 1980s football shirts that seamlessly embraced the style of the times.</p>

<p>Prior to the 1980s, football shirt design remained relatively traditional and understated. Most clubs wore simple stripes, blocks of colour, or the occasional monochrome look. Natural fibers like cotton, wool and linen were standard, limiting bold patterns and colours. However, the late 1970s saw synthetic fabrics like polyester emerge, allowing for more experimentation. Sportswear brands <a href="https://adidas.com/">Adidas</a>, <a href="https://umbro.com/">Umbro</a> and <a href="https://puma.com/">Puma</a> began developing shirts with bold new designs to suit the materials. By the 1980s, shirts moved further from their pedestrian roots with abstract graphics, daring geometrics and vivid neon palettes. New screen-printing and dyeing techniques opened up creative possibilities. As sponsors and brands became more prominent, they encouraged custom designs that made a statement. This intersection of sport, fashion and advertising in the 1980s propelled football shirts into uncharted visual territory.</p>

<p>Ajax&#8217;s rare blue, red and white abstract away kit exemplified the novelty and creativity of the era. Its bold diamond design was a striking symbol of Dutch style.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The 80&#8217;s Style</h3>



<p>Several design motifs defined the bold new football aesthetic of the 1980s. Vibrant, eye-catching colours like bright yellow, neon pink, and electric blue replaced traditional shades. Striped, zig-zag, and abstract graphic prints brought art influences to the kits. Large geometric shapes and diagonal lines conveyed movement and energy. Stars, lightning bolts and other accents added striking details. Manufacturers like Adidas experimented with shoulder designs that extended across the chest. New technologies allowed for gradients, fades, and colour blending on fabric. These common elements came together to create shirts that perfectly aligned with music, fashion and culture in the 1980s. The decade proved that football kits could make provocative artistic statements beyond just team colours and logos.</p>



<p>The bold prints and colours of 1980s football shirts mirrored what was happening across music, fashion, and pop culture in the decade. Kits adopted the bright, neon palette that defined MTV music videos and new wave bands like The Police. Abstract shapes and patterns took inspiration from postmodern art and the Memphis Group furniture designers. Shoulder pad designs were borrowed straight from popular 80s fashions. The avant-garde, rule-breaking ethos of designers like Vivienne Westwood influenced shirts that broke conventions. Brand logos and sponsor placements grew driving commercial trends. Above all, the artful self-expression and experimentation that flourished in the 1980s as artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat redefined culture was embodied by football shirts adopting a similar groundbreaking spirit. The kits crossed over from sport into wider cultural style.</p>

<p>Star players and successful teams drove distinct shirt styles that fans wanted to emulate. Diego Maradona’s transfer to Napoli ignited demand for their light blue jerseys worldwide. Juventus’ Michel Platini wore the team’s iconic black and white stripes as he dominated Serie A. English clubs like Everton and Aston Villa gained international followings through European success, spreading their shirt designs globally. Real Madrid’s all-white look gained prestige as Hugo Sanchez starred for the club. For national teams, Brazilian great Socrates rocked an iconic yellow jersey that Pelé first popularized in the 1970s. On the club level, AC Milan’s Dutch trio Ruud Gullit, Marco van Basten and Frank Rijkaard made the red and black stripes fashionable. Whether through trophies, charisma or flashy styles, individual superstars and teams left an imprint on shirt trends during the decade.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Catapulting Kits into Pop Culture</h3>



<p>The rise of television broadcasts beaming matches into homes worldwide allowed kits to become bold fashion statements. As the sport gained more exposure, shirts adopted brighter palettes and abstract designs to stand out on the small screen. At the same time, corporate sponsorships on jerseys became more prominent. Brands like Coca-Cola, Adidas and Hitachi splashed their logos across shirt fronts, bringing commercialization. The need for shirts to function as both TV-friendly billboards for sponsors and visually striking team identifiers accelerated the artistic evolution. Loud colours, daring prints and prominent branding made kits pop on TV while giving brands coveted screen time. This synergy between television and sponsorships catapulted football shirts from athletic wear into mainstream pop culture.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Back to the future</h3>



<p>Vintage 1980s shirt designs continue influencing the game today. Many clubs are marking anniversaries by bringing back classic designs from the decade. Liverpool recently revived their 1984-85 kit with the original Candy sponsor logo intact. Arsenal released a modern take on their famous yellow and blue zig-zag away strip from the early 90s. Tottenham incorporated their iconic &#8216;Holsten&#8217; sponsor logo across new merchandise. Barcelona and Real Madrid pay homage to 80s kits yearly through retro third jerseys. The vintage trend satisfies nostalgia while underscoring the era&#8217;s lasting cultural impact. 3D graphic prints and neon colours from the 1980s even appear on contemporary kits as a callback. Though recreated with modern fits and fabrics, the retro motif proves today’s designers still draw inspiration from the audacious creativity that defined 1980s shirts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="481" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/united-originals-in-post-1024x481.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-108" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/united-originals-in-post-1024x481.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/united-originals-in-post-300x141.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/united-originals-in-post-768x361.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/united-originals-in-post-1536x721.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/united-originals-in-post.jpg 1704w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Manchester United and Adidas re-release their kit from the late 80&#8217;s (Image via Adidas UK)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The 1980s represented a transformative period for football kit design, when shirts evolved from plain athletic gear into bold pop culture statements. Advances in printing and fabrics allowed designers to experiment with dazzling colours, stripes, shapes and graphics that captured the decade’s avant-garde spirit. Players and teams left an indelible mark on shirt trends through their success and charisma. Television broadcasts and sponsorships accelerated kits shedding their traditional looks for innovative, artistic expression. The era produced some of the most recognizable and aesthetically daring jerseys in history, which still inspire nostalgia and retro revivals today. The 1980s proved football shirts could make provocative artistic statements far beyond just team colours and badges. The decade paved the way for today’s designers to treat kits as contemporary culture pieces rather than merely functional sporting apparel.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="f63d">Championship Manager</h2>



<p id="35ca">The most similar game to Football Manager was of course Championship Manager. In fact, they started out as the same game until the developers, Sports Interactive, and the publishers, Eidos, split in 2003. Sports Interactive kept the game, engine and database and launched Football Manager whereas Eidos kept the name and paired up with a new development studio to continue making Championship Manager.</p>



<p id="7c88">The gameplay was very similar to the original game, but it didn’t quite match up to the familiar game that everyone already loved. It had a similar 2D match engine and even had a licensing deal with Adidas, but fans quickly started switching over to Football Manager.</p>



<p id="365a">After sales began to fall year after year, Eidos decided to pull the plug on Championship Manager, and after a failed Mobile-Only relaunch in the following decade, they finally gave up. The last full PC Championship Manager game was released in 2011, with the mobile game lasting 5 years before Championship Manager was cancelled for good.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="d37e">LMA Manager</h2>

<p id="ef01">One of the most popular football management games of the 2000s was LMA Manager. The console focused game was easily available on the PS2 and offered a 3D match engine which Football Manager didn’t have at the time. The graphics were similar to that of FIFA and PES and this opened up the market to people who didn’t like the spreadsheet look and feel of Football Manager and Championship Manager.</p>



<p id="adc5">The game allowed you to build and upgrade your stadium, create your own team and even had a Match of the Day style highlight show with commentary from Gary Lineker himself.</p>



<p id="19f4">The game was canceled after the release of LMA Manager 2007 as the software the game ran on had issues with newer hardware, but LMA Manager will always remain a fond memory of players in the early 2000s and who could forget some of the great songs used in the intros to the games.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="fd1b">FIFA Manager</h2>



<p id="aa0b">FIFA Manager, or Total Club Manager as it was also called, was EA Sport’s attempt at entering the management simulation market. Utilising the game engine from their popular FIFA Football games, FIFA Manager offered fans something recognisable when playing, compared to the 2D match engine of Football Manager.</p>



<p id="33b4">A big thing for players of FIFA Manager was the official licenses the game had due to EA Sports deals with the FIFA organisation. Leagues and Clubs around the world had their official badges and kits, and the game used real player faces compared to other football management games who had very few official licenses.</p>



<p id="adf3">The game also had a sort of role playing element which allowed the player to spend their managers wages on things like houses, cars and other goods, even if they couldn’t actually do anything with them.</p>



<p id="89e7">EA Sports announced that after the release of FIFA Manager 2014 that they would be canceling the series after poor sales compared to Football Manager. Some fans of the game still play it though, with a small community providing seasonal updates each year so that the game lives on.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="caee">Pro Evolution Soccer Management</h2>

<p id="03b0">Most people who played football games throughout the 2000s probably aren’t even aware there ever was a Pro Evolution Soccer Management game, but in 2006 Konami released their entry into the genre. The PS2 only release was supposed to rival FIFA Manager, just as Pro Evolution Soccer had been the main rival to the FIFA series, but only the 1 instalment was ever released.</p>



<p id="0e76">The game featured the same match engine as PES and shared the few official licenses that game had, but errors in spelling and a slow gameplay put players off. Pro Evolution Soccer Management did feature some role-playing aspects such as having to hire a secretary and having face to face meetings with various staff members and new signings but it wasn’t enough to challenge the already established football management franchises.</p>



<p id="2b40">Konami did release a mobile version of the game during the 2010s, which featured official licenses from various teams each season, but when they rebranded PES to eFootball, they decided to discontinue updates and remove it from the app store.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="748d">Let’s Make A Soccer Team!</h2>



<p id="9cbd">Probably the strangest feature on this list is Let’s Make a Soccer Team! The game was more like a football club chairman simulator but did let you control the tactics of the team as well. It was very similar to Pro Evolution Soccer Management in how it looked and played, and released in Europe in 2006 as an adaptation of a Japanese game.</p>



<p id="9153">Let’s Make a Soccer Team! was unlike all the other games available in the fact that it had a storyline, in which you had an antagonist who was the chairman of a rival club and who you came across throughout the game. You also couldn’t manage a real club in the game, hence the title. The start of the game also made you take part in a play-off, and if you lost you had to start again, which annoyed players because you couldn’t just instantly start like the other football management games.</p>



<p id="0b57">Only the single instalment was ever released, as publishers SEGA, who also publish Football Manager, decided to focus on the already popular franchise instead of publishing new competitors.</p>
